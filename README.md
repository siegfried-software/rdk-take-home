# Overview of the RDK take home assignment:
In this repo are two folders containing the work done for each of the two given activities. The stated objectives from slides 2 and 3 are as follows: 

**Create a command-line application that interacts with the OpenWeather API to manage weather
details of cities.**

**Below is a pseudocode for a more complex algorithm. Your task is to convert it into a working
program in any programming language of your choice. The program should perform the exact
function described in the pseudocode.**

If you are looking to run them locally rather than just view them, please take notice of the instructions below!

# OpenWeather API 
When cloning the repo, note that the project **does use the dependency of dotenv.** If it isn't installed already, use:

> pip install python-dotenv

 The reason for this dependency is to load a local .env file that will contain the user's OpenWeather API key when they themselves create the file. An example of what the .env file should look like has been provided in the form of the file .env.dst. **The program will not work without these two steps!**

To run the program, navigate to the openweather_cli directory and run:

> python3 main.py

For further instructions on how to use the program, type "help" in the command prompt!
# Sorting Algorithm
This program uses python unittest to evaluate answers. To run the tests, simply run the bash script provided for ease of access.
